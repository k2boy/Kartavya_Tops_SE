WAP to show difference between Structure and Union. 

Structure: 
1. Structures are user-defined data types which are used to group together different types of data members such as integers,
   floats, characters, etc. 
2. Data members of a structure can be accessed using dot operator. 
3. The size of a structure depends on the data types of its members.

Union: 
1. Unions are user-defined data types which are used to group together different types of data members such as integers, floats,
   characters, etc. 
2. Data members of a union can be accessed using dot operator. 
3. The size of a union is the size of its largest data member. 
4. All members of a union share the same memory location.
