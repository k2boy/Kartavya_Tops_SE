What is OOP? List OOP concepts

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design applications and computer programs. It focuses on the objects that are essential to the program, rather than the algorithms and procedures used to manipulate the objects.

OOP concepts include:

1. Encapsulation: grouping data and functions that manipulate the data into a single unit.

2. Abstraction: simplifying complex processes by hiding unnecessary details from the user.

3. Inheritance: creating new classes from existing classes, allowing for code reuse and reducing development time.

4. Polymorphism: allowing objects of different types to be treated the same, allowing for more flexibility in code design.

5. Message passing: objects communicate with each other by sending messages.
