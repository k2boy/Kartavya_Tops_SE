What is the difference between OOP and POP? 

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on objects and classes for data management and 
code organization. It is based on the concept of objects, which can contain data in the form of properties, and code in
the form of methods. OOP languages are designed to allow developers to create relationships between data and functions.


Procedural programming (POP) is a type of programming paradigm that is based on a sequence of operations or procedures. 
It is a structured approach to programming in which the program is broken down into a series of functions, subroutines, 
or procedures. The program is written in a step-by-step fashion, with each step providing a specific piece of the puzzle. 
POP is sometimes referred to as imperative programming as it focuses on commands that tell the computer what to do.
